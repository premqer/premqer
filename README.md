**`Code Alchemist`**

I’m an independent front-end developer, focused on creating smooth and functional user experiences. I build every project from scratch, starting with design and planning, and turning ideas into practical, well-coded solutions. I like to explore different paths and technologies, experimenting with various frameworks and tools to find the best approach for each project. My goal is to make the web easier to use, one project at a time.

    <summary><h3>👨‍💻 My coding journey</h3></summary>
        I started my programming journey back in 2022, teaching myself web development in college. My journey began with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and since then, I’ve grown to develop full-fledged web apps and websites. From the beginning, I was drawn to the tech industry and knew I wanted to work in this space. Alongside coding, I’ve always been fascinated by 
        hardware and tech gadgets, which further fueled my interest in technology.
        Looking back, I’m proud of how far I’ve come with my web development skills. Lately, I’ve been reflecting on how much I’ve learned and accomplished, but there’s this feeling that I’ve been playing it too safe. I’ve focused so much on the routine and what’s familiar that I’ve put aside the ideas and projects that truly excite me. It’s easy to stay in that              comfort zone, but now I’m ready to take a risk and chase after what I’m really passionate about.
        I’ve realized that if I really want to see my ideas come to life, I can’t keep waiting for the “perfect” time or the ideal circumstances. It’s time to stop playing it safe and take that leap. So, I’m making some changes to free up more time and focus on building something that’s truly mine. The next chapter of my journey starts now, and I’m ready to face 
        whatever comes my way. I’m not waiting anymore—I’m coming.
